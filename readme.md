# Spain Cloropleth

_Project under development_

The idea of this project is to visualize data on a map of Spain using React and D3JS technologies.

## Input data

Currently three files located in './content/data' are used to draw the map and fill the colors:

- spain-comunidad.json: topojson file with region data.
- spain-municipalities.json: topojson file with municipalities data.
- results.tsv: input data with the most voted party in each municipality.
